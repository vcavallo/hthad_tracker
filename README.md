Tracker for 'How To Host A Dungeon' game
=============

##***In Development...!***

This will be a web app used to track the bookkeeping (non-drawn) parts of a game of [How To Host A Dungeon](http://planet-thirteen.com/Dungeon.aspx).  
From the above website:

>"How to Host a Dungeon is a solo game of dungeon creation where you build a dungeon through its history from the dawn of time"

The game requires plenty of drawing (fun!) but also lots of tracking and rule-consulting (not as fun).  
The aim of this app will be to guide the process by:

- prompting you for the next step in the game
- keeping track of the yearly/sesasonal history so that you don't have to
- generating random results in place of rolls (if you want.. I know dice are fun)
- tracking treasure and populations of many groups at once

I'm gonna go back to coding now. Thanks!
